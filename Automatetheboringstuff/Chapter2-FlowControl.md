3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
```
AND Operator Truth Table

T AND T => T
T AND F => F
F AND T => F
F AND F => F

OR Operator Truth Table

T OR T => T
T OR F => T
F OR T => T
F OR F => F

NOT Operator Truth Table

NOT T => F
NOT F => T
```

  d) not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))<br>
  e) (True and True) and (True == False)<br>
